## About
This is an exercice project about accessibility. The idea is to have a `original` branch with a news websites that have sone accessibility pitfalls. We will make a new branch for every type of problem we will adress : 
- `semantic-html`
- `keyboard-navigation`
- `colors-fonts`
- `images-medias` 
- etc... (non-exhaustive)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.6.

## Semantic Html
Use nav, article, section, etc... Test the difference with a screen reader.

## Keyboard navigation
focus, tabIndex, color on focus.

## Colors & fonts
Contrast and readable font.

## Images & media
Alt text and captions for images, transcripts for videos and/or sub-titles.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
