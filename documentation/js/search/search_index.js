The idea is to have a original branch with a news websites that have sone accessibility pitfalls. We will make a new branch for every type of problem we will adress : \n\nsemantic-html\nkeyboard-navigation\ncolors-fonts\nimages-medias \netc... (non-exhaustive)\n\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 7.0.6.\nSemantic Html\nUse nav, article, section, etc... Test the difference with a screen reader.\nKeyboard navigation\nfocus, tabIndex, color on focus.\nColors & fonts\nContrast and readable font.\nImages & media\nAlt text and captions for images, transcripts for videos and/or sub-titles.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n
